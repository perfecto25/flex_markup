It is similar to TOML and YAML in concept, but is unique in its approach to handling variables and configuration data

## features

- no spacing requirements (yaml)
- braces not necessary (json)
- clean and simple syntax to describe complex data structures
- ability to create template blocks for repeated options
- ability to pass raw strings without using escape sequences
- PAML can natively ingest shell environment variables at runtime
